            - "Feels like an expensive spa treatment! cooling, de-puffing, and brightening all in one."
            - "The texture, the packaging, the results‚Äîeverything about these eye patches screams luxury."
            - "pehli baar try kiya aur accha laga, mujhe lagta h regular use se aur best result milega"
